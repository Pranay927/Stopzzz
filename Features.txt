Counter App Features (React + Tailwind CSS)

1. Start, Stop, and Reset Buttons:
   - Start: Begins the counter, incrementing the value by 1 every second.
   - Stop: Pauses the counter, keeping the current value.
   - Reset: Resets the counter value to zero.

2. Persistent Counter:
   - Even if you refresh the page, the counter value stays the same because it is saved in localStorage.

3. Automatic Saving:
   - Every time the counter updates, the new value is stored in localStorage.


5. Clean UI with Tailwind CSS:
   - Styled with Tailwind for a modern look (buttons with colors, rounded edges, shadows, and hover effects).

Overall: A minimal, functional, and persistent counter app.
